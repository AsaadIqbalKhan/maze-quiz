# maze-quiz
a terminal-based application that generates a random maze, finds a path
from the start to the end, and visualizes the maze and path in the terminal.

The maze is represented as a 2D array where each cell can be either a wall or
an open space.
The top-left corner is the start (S) and the bottom-right corner is the end (E).
The application provides options to print the path, generate another
puzzle, or exit the game.
The number of random walls is restricted to be 25
% of the total cells to increase the likelihood of a solvable maze.
